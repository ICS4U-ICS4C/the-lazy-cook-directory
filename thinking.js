/**
 * Jasmine' thoughts:
 * so, we'd take input, add it to a list(stock)
 * and then check, for items(ingredient) in stock
 * if recipe has only ingredient from stock
 *      return recipe(s)
 * elif recipe has only some of ingreadient from stock and nothing else,
 *      return recipe(s)
 * else print("Sorry man, you gotta make a trip to walmart soon")
 * we could easly(not easily bu yeh) do this with textfiles
 * considerin we barley have time lect
 * to work with firebase
